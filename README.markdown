IDL Library
==================================================
4+ years coding in [IDL](http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx) for my [PhD](http://brunosan.eu/about-2/work/phd/) thesis in solar physics. I thought may be someone can make use of some of the .pro I've gathered or made during that time.

[GDL](http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/) (GNU Data Language) is a free/libre/open source incremental compiler compatible with IDL


Contributors and timeline
------------------------------
* I first coded IDL at the U. of La Laguna, 2003-2004
* Then 3 years of IDL coding at the Max Planck and U. Goettingen in Germany (2005-2008)
* then 1 more at NRL, Washington.

To Do
-----

* Explain the contents of the repo and add the official lib so that one could fork and use this repo as-is.

Why I am doing this
------------------

* Because, finally, there is a fairly easy and powerful way to share, contribute and publish your code.
* Because it took me a lot of time to end up with a working set of .pros and I hope this help the next ones.
* Because I've spend many hours coding many little tools I wished I had.
* Because, according to the Max Planck rules, one should make available the data of your PhD thesis so that your results are replicable. And I strongly agree with this.
