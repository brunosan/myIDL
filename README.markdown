IDL Library
==================================================
4+ years coding in [IDL](http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx) for my [PhD](http://brunosan.eu/about-2/work/phd/) thesis in solar physics. I thought may be someone can make use of some of the .pro I've gathered or made during that time.

[GDL](http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/) (GNU Data Language) is a free/libre/open source incremental compiler compatible with IDL
