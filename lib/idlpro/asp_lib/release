	*** This Release of ASP IDL Code ***

- modified aspedit.pro to save original nscan information
  (only if it's not already in the header)

- modified calibrate.pro to save original nscan information *only if* it's not
  already in the header; have it *accumulate* input_x1 and input_y1 information

- upgraded bell.pro to permit ringing the bell a specified number of times

- added 'count' argument to get_words.pro, filed bug, and improved usage

- upgraded in_set.pro (returns count, better error checking, faster)

- new routine check_readme.pro to check that ASP IDL README file is up to date;
  README file made up to date

- modified stringit.pro to keep internal spaces

- added nopause keyword to pause.pro for nicer menuing

===============================================================================

- added 'scale' keyword to plot_4.pro for scaling spectra based on
  maximum-I; simplified code that scales Q and U together

- new routine aspmovie.pro to manipulate movies; currently separates
  multiple-map movie files into separate files called <input>.1, <input>.2, ...

- made scan renumbering optional now via new 'fscan0' keyword in aspedit.pro

- added 'raw_nscan' keyword to calibrate.pro for setting op header extension
  'orig_nscan' field (used by the inversion code), explicitly for version 100
  short operations (truncated with aspedit)

- modified aspedit.pro to set the op header extension values;
  added 'exten' keyword for versatile control of this setting

- modified read_op_hdr.pro to not zero the extension part of op headers
  (was doing so for all but 'Gain[XT]'-type operations)

-------------------------------------------

- modified plot_4.pro to accept a negative 'xscan' implying a thick (3-pixel)
  line be drawn as opposed to the 1-pixel line that was sometimes not visible
  in PostScript due to scaling; fixed bug where min/max values were incorrect
  (were in pixel space rather than in raw data units)

-------- November 4, 1994 -----------------

- new routine rem_clouds.pro to remove clouds

- increased structure field name maximum length in helps.pro, used in h.pro

- added information to helplist.pro listing

-------------------------------------------

- added new routine rev_scans.pro to reverse scan order and numbering

- added rev_scan keyword to calibrate.pro; made calibrate by default reverse
  scan order on maps recorded after 1 November 1993

- rewrote float_str.pro to round on either side of decimal point (negative
  as well as positive 'ndigits'), and not have side effect

- rewrote roundit.pro to work for arrays as well as scalars, removed
  side-effect of modifying the input value, and now can round on either
  side of the decimal point

- wrote truncit.pro to *truncate* floats to a specified number of digits
  (rather than *round* to a number of digits as roundit.pro does)

- added 'noaa' and 'qnoaa' keywords to shg.pro for NOAA active region numbers;
  modified shgplot.pro to use the NOAA numbers saved by shg.pro

-------- October 13, 1994 -----------------

- added laser_sl.pro to create laser profile for inversion code

- added gauss1.pro for RSI's CURVEFIT (used in laser_sl.pro)

-------------------------------------------

- fixed bug in calibrate.pro checking the number of parameters

- fixed bug in flip[x|y].pro (off-by-1 on even dimensioned arrays, thus
  middle [cols|rows] were not flipped -- actually flipped then flipped back)

-------- September 27, 1994 ---------------

- removed clears from calibrate.pro (and calib_res.pro) since they are
  no longer used (note argument list shortened!)

- modified plotting in calibrate.pro:
	now choose between (no plotting | plotting | plotting with pauses)
	now get plots of final calibrated spectra
	removed plotting inefficiencies

- removed plotting from wlcross.pro (was a buggy duplicate of what was
  done correctly in 'calibrate'); removed inefficiencies and formatted

- added 'ans' keyword to pause.pro so can do simple menuing with it

-------- September 22, 1994 ---------------

- modified calibrate.pro so can calculate slope for de-skewing based
  generically on one hairline or two (i.e., the one hairline may be
  the top or bottom one)

- added 'cameras' keyword to calibrate (and calib_res and calib_xmat) so
  can process A only, B only, or both cameras

- fixed bug in calibrate.pro so it correctly plots the difference btw A & B

-------------------------------------------

- modified fix_rec.pro so it can work for any run year

- have aspcal.pro read 4 blank lines of X matrix so works like calibrate.pro

-------- August 31, 1994 ------------------

- collapsed functionality of flat_filtd/genfiltd/get_filtd/buildgn2 to
  flat_filtd/genfiltd (removed get_filtd and buildgn2)

- made 'nend' an optional keyword in flat_filtd/genfiltd

- added 3rd level of verbosity to flat_filtd.pro, flatavg2.pro, and
  avgscans_i.pro

- simplified flat_filtd.pro as it can simply pass arguments to flatavg2
  and genfiltd and let them do error checking and default setting;
  did similar thing with flatavg2

- modified flatavg2.pro to have 'bads' be optional keyword, rather than
  a parameter; thus could/did simplify the call in flat_filtd.pro
  (note that optional parameters are best as keywords !)

- updated comments in various codes concerning gainit vs. calibrate

-------------------------------------------

- fixed extend.pro to handle nst=0

-------- August 26, 1994 ------------------

- added procedure 'pwspec.pro' from Bruce to determine average power spectrum;
  note there are two methods for apodization (see 'apod' keyword)

  rather than a multi-period one; sped it up by replacing loop with array
  operations; added 'nomean' keyword and functionality to subtract mean; etc.

- modified 'extend.pro' by replacing loops with array operations for speed;
  various commenting/cleanup/etc.

- added procedure 'split_spec.pro' to split spectra by wavelength into 2 files

- removed unused 'tree.pro' (was a list of routines rather than a routine)

- modification to 'shsl.pro' by Sku to handle ixst >= 15

-------------------------------------------

- added procedure bell.pro to ring the bell

- modified Makefile for Solaris compilation of gncorrc.so for gncorr.pro

- modified run_shg.pro to use lp rather than lpr (for Solaris)

- added 'mstepsz' keyword to shgplot.pro for when map step size is zero

-------- June 3, 1994 ---------------------

- rewrote aspedit.pro to be more versatile in processing movies;
  note the argument list has changed

- bomb with error message now if try to skip too far with skip_scan.pro

- new routines put_version, put_nmap, get_nmap to work with op header values

- using p.pro on undefined variables will return to caller now

- modified low level routine read_op_hdr.pro to print "Map Movie Frames"
  rather than "Filter Steps Stepsize" to better reflect the actual use
  of the operation header

- small mod's to shg[plot].pro to ensure nfstep is a long integer

-------------------------------------------

- added another example to 'aspedit' usage (for fixing short files)

- mod's to filt.pro to correct indexing errors by Bruce

- simplified fixr.pro to make use of new 'round' function

- modified codes so keyword 'run' accepts 'mar92' or anything-else(def),
  rather than just 'mar92'(def) or 'jun92'
  [buildgn2.pro genfiltd.pro get_filtd.pro filt.pro flat_filtd.pro]

- added encapsulated keword to shgplot.pro; added note to shg.pro usage

- changed 'fix' to 'floor' in float_str.pro to handle larger numbers

-------- April 6, 1994 --------------------

- modified routines for proper use of /v101 and get_version() since there
  are versions other than simply 100 and 101 now

  (i.e., all PLOT keywords are now permitted for the graph*.pro routines)

-------- November 29, 1993 ----------------

- added sign.pro function to return the sign of a number

- added 'i_scl -> v_scl' parameters to 'aspview.pro' so can scale the
  spectra arbitrarily and independently (also added those parameters to

  improved print of raw data range in 'aspview.pro' (i.e., 'xs1 to ys2')

- improved 'plot_4.pro' (much better code & comments; removed profiling);
  improved 'pprun' (code and comments)

- added 'ca.pro' to close all files

  now if input fscan:  scans removed in gainit.pro; bad_* used in abmerge.pro)

- removed get_s.pro (unfinished and not to be used)
- removed asp_scale.pro (no longer used)

- replaced make_help.pro with 'make_help' script (does clean-up editing now;
  took prints out of mk_asp_help.pro that reminded to do clean-up)

- modified all *.pro routines with examples to use new naming convention

-------------------------------------------

  for raw-wavelength OR flipped-wavelength orientation)

- removed 'ixst' from calcross.pro and calmerge.pro (not used)

- sped up hair, ofstc2, etc. (e.g., redundant initializations of arrays)

- combined hair and onehair into new hair.pro; reversed usage of ixst so
  hair works on wavelength-flipped data now <-- note that hair.pro was
  used incorrectly in gain_xt3.pro (data was flipped, but hair assumed NOT)
